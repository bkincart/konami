### Introduction

The Konami Code is a video game cheat code which was a secret feature of
[many video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Konami_code_games)
over the years. Pressing the following key sequence would unlock secrets of the
game or give you extra lives.

These days, the Konami Code isn't only limited to video games. It has infiltrated
the web! Try the Konami Code on any of the following websites:

* [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)
* [digg](http://digg.com/)
* [cornify](http://www.cornify.com/)

In this exercise, you will create an Easter Egg within an existing webpage by integrating an external JavaScript library.

### Getting Started

```no-highlight
$ cd ~/challenges
$ et get konami-code
$ cd konami-code
$ open index.html
```

### Instructions

First, read about [Konami-js](http://code.snaptortoise.com/konami-js/) and
figure out how to use it. There are some good examples on the library's homepage.

Next, add the [Konami-js](http://code.snaptortoise.com/konami-js/) library to
the `index.html` file. Here's a URL to a CDN hosting the library:
